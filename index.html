        <p>My degree is CIT. I currently have a job lined out for me with a company called NUVEK.</p>
        <p>I love camping, dirt biking, music, and video games.</p>
        <p>I am not yet married, but that will change in less than a year when I ask the love of my life to marry me.</p>
        <p>There are many advantages to web design as many companies are in demand of good web designers to help with the creation/upholding of their websites. Im taking this course to fulfill the requirements of my major.</p>
        <p>I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints my entire life. I dont know if I have a favorite quote at this moment but my favorite talk is by Bruce R. McConkie titled The Purifying Power of Gethsemane. My favorite scripture is Moroni 7:29, look it up and you wont be disapointed.</p>
